# SmartSymptomClassifier
SmartSymptomClassifier is an intelligent medical triage assistant powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and LangGraph. It simulates how a hospital or virtual clinic might handle patient symptom inputs and classify them into categories like Mental Health, Physical Ailments, and more.

#What It Does
Welcomes the user (e.g., "Welcome to XYZ Hospital")
Takes a symptom input (e.g., "I have relation issues")
Uses an LLM to classify the symptom (e.g., "Mental Health")
Outputs a smart response, like:
'I have relation issues' : seems like a mental health issue – talk to our counsellor.

#Technologies Used
Python
LangGraph
OpenAI LLM (or any preferred LLM backend)
Jupyter Notebook interface

#Use Cases
AI-based patient support systems
Triage assistant bots
Mental and physical health classification demos
Educational/Research purposes on AI in healthcare

#How to Run
Clone the repository
Install dependencies
Open Deep_langgraph.ipynb in Jupyter
Run the notebook and test symptom inputs

#Example
Input: "I have relation issues"
LLM Output: "Mental Health"
Final Message: "'I have relation issues' : seems like a mental health issue – talk to our counsellor."
